## Overview

This repository contains all the files used for developing the WordPress theme for The Lion Inn website.

The Lion Inn is a pub in Trellech, Monmoutshire, Wales.

### Start to Finish

#### Phase 1 - Alpha (Complete)

The target for phase 1 was to create a barebones, MVP site that included the home, food, menu and events sections.  This needed to be done as early as possible so that the Christmas menu would be live in plenty of time of people to view and book.

This was achieved on Sunday 4th November 2018.

The 'alpha' was released with an acceptably functioning website including the required sections explained above.  The events section was released without the desired functionality of the embedded scrollable upcoming events section (refer to docs/designs/pngs/desktop.png) to see what I mean.

No WordPress functionality was included in this release.  However, this design will be used as the first versoin of the theme used for WordPress - lioninn-alpha. 

### Phase 2 - WordPress Integration of Alpha Theme (Current)

Following on from phase 1, the next phase is to create a WordPress version of the alpha site.  The main goal of this phase is for the menu and (potentially) the events sections to be editable (add, edit, delete menu items & event items).

### Phase 3 - Beta

Back to theme development, as opposed to WordPress development.  Phase 3 will focus on adding the remaining sections (about us, gallery, and accommodation).  

The goal being the release of the lioninn-beta theme.

### Phase 4 - WordPress Integration of Beta Theme

Once the lioninn-beta theme is finished, I will integrate the new beta theme into WordPress. 

When this site is released, we will begin to move out of the beta stage and into a finalised product.  As bugs and improvements get resolved following the beta release, the site will form into a fully functioning and (hopefully) lasting product.  

### Phase 5 - Maintenance

The final phase - maintenance - will essentially be a constant on-going phase.  I expect the busiest part of this phase to be in the months following the final big release.  It will slowly get quieter and quieter over time.
