Does the copyright need to change from 2014 to 2018?

Once finished, how do I upload new site?
Answer:
Control Panel / FTP Client - upload all files of site to here (web folder)

IMPORTANT: take backup of current files in web folder, incase anything goes wrong
			THEN - remove current files and input my files


WordPress - either use built-in 1-Click Install (however this can be bad as site is then live straight away) 
			OR create site elsewhere (localhost/WordPress) and then use FTP client to add files 
			
			
DESIGN TODO:

- REDO whatever design I choose, but with a 960 center rather than the current larger center (to see what it looks like - based off of what I have read online).

- Stock photo needs to be replaced by actual cottage photo (not during design phase).

- Mobile version of site in PS
	- Fix title section
	- Check title font sizes all match

- Should I add a dashboard so that events can be added as well?
	- Or do this within WordPress if possible?
	
	
	
PLAN:
	- Finish mobile design.
		- MILESTONE: 
			- Happy with mobile design version.
			- Happy with desktop version.
	
	- MVP
		- Create theme that includes HOME, MENU & EVENTS sections.
		- Save this as a theme - lioninn-alpha
		- Begin to setup WordPress and plug this all in
		- Deadline - Start of December.
		- MILESTONE: 
			- Home section complete. 
			- Food section complete.
			- Events section complete.
			- Food --> Menu page (menu page complete).
			- Fully responsive for tablets and phones.
	
	- Addition of remaining sections.
		- Add remaining sections.
		- Create new theme - lioninn-beta
		- Deadline - TBD
		- MILESTONE: 
			- All sections added to theme.
			- Theme uploaded and plugged into site.
			
	- Maintenance
		- Fix any bugs or issues that arise
		- Ensure Deb can add & edit menu page and events page.
